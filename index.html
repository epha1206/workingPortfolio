            <p> My name is Elvis Pham. I have lived in the south Florida area for the majority of my life. I went to Palm Beach State and Broward College for a few years to try to find something I was interested in. I picked up on coding a few months ago but have always wondered about how websites work and are made. It has been an exciting process so for and I am ready to learn more.</p>

            <p> I am an extremely organized person who is focused on producing results. I consistently develop ways to achieve goals. I enjoy problem solving and coming up with solutions in a timely manner. I am comfortable with adjusting to any situation and I don't get flustered easily when faced with unexpected challenges.</p>
